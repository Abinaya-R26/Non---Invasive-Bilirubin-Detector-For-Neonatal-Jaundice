ABSTRACT : 
â€”Neonatal jaundice is one of the most 
common conditions affecting newborns worldwide. It 
results from elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood, 
often leading to visible yellowing of the skin and eyes. 
Early identification is crucial to avoid complications 
such as kernicterus or neurological damage. In this 
study, we propose a simple and cost-effective method 
for detecting signs of jaundice using a combination of 
camera-based imaging and basic color analysis. By 
capturing live skin images and analyzing them in color 
spaces such as YCbCr, RGB, and HSV, the system can 
differentiate between normal and jaundiced skin 
tones without invasive testing. When jaundice is 
detected, a signal is sent to an Arduino controller to 
activate an LED indicator, simulating the initiation of 
phototherapy treatment. The approach aims to offer 
a non-invasive, real-time screening tool, particularly 
useful in resource-limited settings where access to 
laboratory testing is delayed or unavailable. Our 
system is designed to assist healthcare workers and 
parents by providing an early warning, ensuring 
timely medical attention. Through careful calibration 
and analysis, this method demonstrates potential for 
improving neonatal care by making jaundice 
detection more accessible, affordable, and rapid.
